# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

### Project Outcomes

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Performed unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involved four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.

### Duration

Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes

### Project Description

This project applied unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset and used data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.

The dataset for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store. The project involved the following tasks:

#### Exploratory Data Analysis and Pre-processing

- **Data Import and Cleaning**: Loaded the dataset and handled any missing values, duplicates, and outliers, ensuring the dataset was ready for analysis.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Analyzed and visualized relationships between different variables in the dataset using tools like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features or modified existing ones to improve the analysis. Normalized and standardized data to make variables comparable across different scales.

#### Unsupervised Learning

- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - **Determined Optimal Number of Clusters**: Used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

  - **Clustering Analysis**: Applied KMeans clustering to group similar data points together. Interpreted and visualized the clusters to identify patterns.

- **Hierarchical Clustering**:

  - **Dendrogram Analysis**: Created a dendrogram to determine the optimal number of clusters.

  - **Clustering Analysis**: Applied hierarchical clustering to group similar data points together. Interpreted and visualized the clusters to identify patterns.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:

  - **Variance Explanation**: Determined the variance explained by each principal component to understand the importance of each component.

  - **Loadings Analysis**: Examined the loadings of each principal component to interpret which original features contribute most to the variance.

  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduced the dataset's dimensionality to the most significant principal components and visualized the results to identify underlying structures.

#### Communicating Insights

- **Data Visualization**: Used visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis, including cluster plots, PCA biplots, and heatmaps.

- **Stakeholder Reporting**: Summarized findings in a clear and concise manner to inform stakeholders about the patterns and insights discovered through the unsupervised learning techniques.

### Goals

- **Insight Generation**: Gained actionable insights from the dataset that can help in making informed business decisions.

- **Visualization**: Effectively communicated the results and insights through visualizations.

- **Technical Skills**: Developed and demonstrated skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and unsupervised learning techniques.

By completing this project, valuable insights were provided into the wholesale data, natural groupings of products were identified, and the underlying structure of the dataset was understood, all communicated through clear and effective visualizations.
